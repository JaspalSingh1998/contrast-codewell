# Welcome to Codewell! ðŸ‘‹

Codewell's aim is to provide you with real-world design templates that you can use to practice your HTML and CSS projects.

Free or paid, all templates are high quality and will make great portfolio pieces.

# Things I've learnt

1. Tailwind CSS
2. CSS GRID and Flexbox (For layouts)
3. JavaScript Loops, eventlisteneres
4. FetchApi for dynamic data
5. Template Tag (HTML5)

## Note

- I've skipped the submit functionallity purposely, because I don't want to clutter my json files with noisy data.
